Problem statement

CT Scan Image Classification



Data Overview


The used dataset contains 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total. These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify if a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans.


I have used google colab for the coding purpose.

The DataSet downloaded from the link :https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WOeodRmv1Mw5Cswuip3nUIi6ViQWKpo_?usp=sharing is mounted to mydrive and trained the same.
